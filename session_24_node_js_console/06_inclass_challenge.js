const essay = `Global Warming: A Threat to Our Planet
Global Warming, the ongoing rise in Earth's average temperature primarily from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, is a significant threat to our planet, leading to extreme weather, rising sea levels, mass extinctions, and disruptions to ecosystems and human health. Key causes include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities. Impacts are seen in more frequent heatwaves, floods, droughts, and stronger storms, alongside threats to food security, water resources, and coastal communities. Addressing this crisis requires global, collective action, including transitioning to renewable energy, reducing waste, promoting sustainable practices, and improving energy efficiency.`;
